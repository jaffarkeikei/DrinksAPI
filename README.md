## Components

### Database

The backbone of the Simple Drinks API is its database, which stores information about various drinks. The database schema includes tables for drinks, ingredients, categories, reviews, and users. It is designed to be scalable and efficient, ensuring quick access to data.

### API Endpoints

The API provides several endpoints to interact with the database:

- `/drinks`: Retrieve a list of all drinks or a specific drink by ID.
- `/search`: Search for drinks based on various criteria.
- `/categories`: Get a list of drink categories.
- `/ingredients`: Access a list of ingredients.
- `/reviews`: Post and retrieve reviews for drinks.

### Authentication

To contribute to the database or leave reviews, users must be authenticated. The API uses token-based authentication to ensure secure access to its features.

### Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, the API implements rate limiting. Users are allowed a certain number of requests per minute, with the limit varying based on the user's role (e.g., regular user, contributor, administrator).
